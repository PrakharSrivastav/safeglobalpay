											<li>
												<strong>No Surcharges. </strong>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> as a payment method.

											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Taxes. </strong>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.

														<strong>Arbitration Procedures. </strong>
														<p>
															Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutralarbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator also must follow the terms of this User Agreement as a court would.
														</p>
														<p>
															The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at http://www.adr.org.The arbitration shall be held in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
														</p>
														<p>
															If the value of the reliefsought is $2,000 or less, you or <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> may elect to have the arbitrationconducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shallbe binding on you and <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> subject to the arbitrator's discretion to requirean in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearingmay be made by telephone by you and/or <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span>, unless the arbitrator requiresotherwise.
														</p>
														<p>
															The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of South Dakota, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Costs of Arbitration.</strong>
														<p>
															Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. You will pay all filling, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Severability.</strong>
														<p>
															With the exception of any of the provisions in subsection (a) of this Agreement toArbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in subsection (a) of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the User Agreement, including all other provisions will continue to apply.

													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Future Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong>
														<p>
															Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> prior to the effective date of the change.

									</ul>
								</p>
								<h4 class="text-left"><strong>How We Share Personal Information with Other <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> Users</strong></h4>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> users with whom who you transact through <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span>. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> Services.

										</li>
										<li>
											We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or send payments from or to you using <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span>. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, to inform you that a payment has been sent to you or when you attempt to pay a merchant or third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> customer and that <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> as a form of payment can be enabled, or to send you notification of payment status. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> customer with a third party, we will do so.

										<li>
											Please note that merchants, sellers, and users you buy from or contract with have their own privacy policies, and although <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span>’s user agreement does not allow the other transacting party to use this information for anything other than providing <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> Services, <span class="text-success">AyjoConsulting</span> is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.

										</li>
										<li>
